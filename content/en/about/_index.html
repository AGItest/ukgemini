<p class="lead mt-5">UK GEMINI (GEo-spatial Metadata INteroperability Initiative) is a specification for a set of metadata elements for describing geospatial data resources. It has been produced and is maintained by the Standards Committee. It is provided free of charge by the AGI for the benefit of the GI community, under a Creative Commons license.

<h1 class="text-center">UK GEMINI 2.3</h1>
<p>The AGI Standards Committee published version 2.3 of UK GEMINI in June 2018.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GEMINI 2.3</a></strong></p>
<p>This revision incorporates material prepared by the UK Location Programme, previously published at <a title="UK location on data.gov.uk" href="https://data.gov.uk/location" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data.gov.uk</a>, and material previously published as separate guidance documents. We hope this consolidation will make it easier for you to use. GEMINI has also been updated for change requests from revised INSPIRE guidance and UK users.  The AGI is grateful to Defra for funding part of this work, and for several AGI members also contributing.</p>
<p>The existing guidelines on the quality of metadata still apply: Guidelines for UK GEMINI Part 3 Metadata Quality <div class="phocadownloadfile16"><a href="/about/resources/category/81-gemini?download=100:metadata-guidelines-part-3-april-2015" target="_self" >Metadata Guidelines Part 3 April 2015</a></div></p>
<p>UK INSPIRE announced their intention to require data publishers to migrate to GEMINI 2.3 by December 2019, in line with the target date from Europe for adopting the current version of their INSPIRE Technical Guidance. However, technical implementations have been delayed.<strong> </strong>UK INSPIRE, and the data.gov.uk system in particular, will continue to accept GEMINI 2.2 records encoded according to UK Location guidance, at least until then - although they may generate warning messages from the EU portal.</p>
<p>GEMINI 2.3 does not include any changes related to the publication of ISO 19115-1:2014; GEMINI remains based on ISO 19115:2003.</p>
